This is a Japanese translation of OpenJSCAD documents.

I also made a javadoc document of csg.js API.
See api/.
Online version is 
- http://kariya.cc/api/html_en/
- http://kariya.cc/api/html_jp/

In addition I use this repo to store my sample jscad codes.
Currently it contains:
- boltAndNut.jscad: bolt and nut generator.
- parser.jscad: experimental solid parser.
- Japanese-traditional-wood-joint/ : literally
- animation/ : literally
  - clock_animation.jscad: simple clock animation
  - puzzle.jscad: enjoy!
  - gear.jscad: rotating 3 gears!
- util/: misc utility functions.


Animation movies are on youtube:

I added wiki pages, currently tips pages(English and Japanese).
