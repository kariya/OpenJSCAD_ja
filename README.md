This is a Japanese translation of OpenJSCAD documents.
I made a javadoc document of csg.js API.

Also I use this repo to store my sample jscad codes.
Currently it contains:
- boltAndNut.jscad: bolt and nut generator.
- utils.jscad: misc utility functions.
- parser.jscad: experimental solid parser.
- Japanese-traditional-wood-joint/ : literally
